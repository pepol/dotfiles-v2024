# Tmux session context

The agent runs inside a tmux pane. Determine your location by running tmux commands in the terminal.

## Commands to determine agent location

Ensure `~/.local/scripts` is in PATH, then run these whitelisted wrappers:

**Current session, window, pane:**
```bash
cursor-tmux-where
```
Output order: session_name, window_index, window_name, pane_index, pane_id (e.g. `%0`).

**All panes in current window with geometry (for resolving left/right/up/down):**
```bash
cursor-tmux-panes
```
Output per line: pane_id pane_index pane_left pane_top pane_right pane_bottom. Use this to find which pane is to the left (smaller `pane_left`, vertically overlapping), right (larger `pane_left` or `pane_right` abutting current), above, or below the current pane.

## Interpreting user references

- **"Left pane" / "left window"** = the tmux pane to the **left** of the pane where the agent is running (same window, pane with smaller x / to the left in layout).
- **"Right pane" / "right window"** = pane to the **right** of the agent's pane.
- **"Top pane" / "above"** = pane **above** the agent's pane.
- **"Bottom pane" / "below"** = pane **below** the agent's pane.
- **"Other pane"** = the other pane in a 2-pane layout, or clarify from context.
- **"Window 2" / "window N"** = tmux window index N in the current session (from `window_index` or `tmux list-windows`).

When the user refers to "the left window", "in the other pane", etc., run the tmux commands above to identify your pane and the target pane, then interpret their request accordingly.
